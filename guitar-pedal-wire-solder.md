R13 is miswired!!
RV2 is not there - so neither are solder bridges to wires

- wire to right above Q4 i just soldered directly down instead of diagonal
- wire from centre of D1 i just soldered directly right instead of diagonal

battery terminals still need solder bridges

diagonal connection between R18 and R19 isn't done (with solder or wire?)
